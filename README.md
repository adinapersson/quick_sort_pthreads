# Parallel quicksort algorithm using Pthreads

An implementation, optimization and parallelization of a quicksort
algorithm. The parallelization of the algorithm will be done using Pthreads and the code is written in C. 

In order to achieve good performance for the quicksort algorithm the selection of the pivot element and compiler flags are optimized. To optimize the performance the code is also parallelized and tail recursion is implemented. 

The data, which is sorted by the quicksort algorithm, is an array consisting of non-negative double precision values between 0.0 and
1.0.
