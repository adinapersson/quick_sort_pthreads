# Parallel quicksort algorithm using Pthreads

An implementation, optimization and parallelization of a quicksort
algorithm. The parallelization of the algorithm will be done using Pthreads and the code is written in C. 

In order to achieve good performance for the quicksort algorithm the selection of a proper pivot element is of great importance, here, the pivot element selection will be investigated along with other possible
optimizations.

The data, which is sorted by the quicksort algorithm, is an array consisting of non-negative double precision values between 0.0 and
1.0.
